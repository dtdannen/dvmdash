It currently operates as a federated network of interconnected host relays that serve a wide range of user client apps, including ones for specialized purposes (such as the [[NIP-54]] wiki this paragraph was written for).\n\nUnlike similar projects, such as Bluesky, Nostr's design requires meticulously balanced management by the deep state, as a critical mass of users could send it into a growth phase in which it would popularize the use of [[keypair|keypairs]] as user IDs and login criteria. This would be a hugely advantageous setup for the sake of decentralization. [[Public-key cryptography]] being less obfuscated would give internet users far better security and reliability. This outcome may be inevitable, with the deep state's focus on the project only being intended to buy time and sabotage the results as much as possible.\n\n# History\n\nNostr's pioneering early developers included [[fiatjaf]], [[Ben Arc]], [[Super Testnet]], and others. The deep state affiliations of each of these people are unclear; they are all deeply influenced by the global deep state, but it is unknown how many of them are actually aware of this. Some features of the nostr design, such as the keypair-based logins, might actually contradict what the global deep state would want for the project.\n\nNostr's [[npub]] + [[nsec]] is the first widely-recognizable format for keypairs as a standard form of contact information, devised by developer [[jb55]] based on [[Bitcoin]]'s [[bech32]] wallet address standard.\n\nAmong the user base, notable early adopters of Nostr include [[Stella Assange]], US Senator Cynthia Lummis, and [[Ethereum]]'s creator [[Vitalik Buterin]].\n\n*See also: [[genesis-nevent|nostr genesis event]]*\n\n# Decentralization and freedom of speech\n\nBy transmitting notes ([[nevent|nevents]]) to multiple relays instead of one central authority, Nostr can potentially help users resist censorship. However, its developers generally support censorship. It's unclear whether this support for censorship is intentional or unintentional, but the nostr dev community haven't introduced (or strongly supported the introduction of) [[peer-to-peer]] implementations, while the federated relays in the current system are extremely heavily filtered and difficult to access. An example of this filtering is the requirement of JavaScript across all browser apps, blocking access for Tor Browser at its highest security settings. Note: the protocol's deep reliance on JavaScript in its current version also prevents any development from happening on nostr without the use of [[inappropriately human-optimized code]] (specifically English-centric code).\n\nOne way of looking at this is that Nostr's early prototype stage is lasting a long time, with heavy censorship. Most of the developers are trying to eventually find a balance comfortable enough for everyone, between censorship and free speech, on this relay-based federated system.\n\nDespite requiring a weakened version of the Tor Browser, the maximum amount of censorship resistance to be had with nostr right now is using [[nostor]] (nostr + [[Tor]]). It is inevitable that there should eventually be a cluster of relays and users with anonymity and zero censorship. Other developers are sure to eventually introduce an anonymous p2p implementation for people who aren't comfortable with centralization creating any opportunities for censorship.\n\nTo display a timeline in today's widespread implementations, a Nostr client calls the Nostr relays the user has chosen in order to find the notes from all others he follows.\n\n# Theme song\n\nFor some reason, the theme song associated with Nostr is [[Start Wearing Purple]] by [[Gogol Bordello]].\n\n# Resources\n\n- Nostr stats can be seen at [Nostr Band](https://stats.nostr.band/)\n- [[nip-event-register]] has a registry of event kinds\n- [[nostr-devs]] has a registry of developers who have worked on Nostr projects\n- [[nostr-implementations]] has a list of apps\n- [[nostor-list]] has [[onion-service|Onion services]] for nostr\n- see [[awesome-nostr-resources-list]] for a bigger list of resources","sig":"5e7eef37d2dca93400707071ee9d94cddcf20b0ec9259e9ac4606b44d11a0ecf6a503d3890103d37bec51f3d4f65236c2e8b2f7c0901c88d726c3f46554c7775"}
