# dvmdash

DVMDash aims to be a monitoring and debugging tool for DVM activity on Nostr. Data Vending Machines (nip-90) offload computationally expensive tasks from relays and clients in a decentralized, free-market manner. They are especially useful for AI tools, algorithmic processing of userâ€™s feeds, and many other use cases.

The project is pre-alpha. Main branch is not guaranteed to be stable.

A version of the website is running here:

## Install

- Use Python3.11
  - As of May 13th, 2024, Python 3.12 is unsupported
- If you are only using scripts/ (i.e. listengin for DVM events, you should only need requirements_backend.txt)
