DVMDash aims to be a monitoring and debugging tool for DVM activity on Nostr. Data Vending Machines (nip-90) offload computationally expensive tasks from relays and clients in a decentralized, free-market manner. They are especially useful for AI tools, algorithmic processing of userâ€™s feeds, and many other use cases.

The project is pre-alpha. Main branch is not guaranteed to be stable.

A version of the website is running here:
