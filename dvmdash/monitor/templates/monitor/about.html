{% block content %}

    <p>DVMDash aims to be a monitoring and debugging tool for DVM activity on Nostr.
        <a href="https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/90.md">Data Vending Machines (nip-90)</a>
        offload computationally expensive tasks from
        relays and clients in a decentralized, free-market manner. They are especially
        useful for AI tools, algorithmic processing of userâ€™s feeds, and many other use cases.</p>

    <p>This app is primarily geared towards developers. If something doesn't work or to request a feature,
        please <a href="https://github.com/dtdannen/dvmdash/issues/new">submit a PR</a>. This project is under
        active development.</p>

    <h3>Description of Pages:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="{% url 'metrics' %}">Metrics</a>: Show metrics of all DVM events that we have been able to collect from relays from all time. This page is slow to load and needs to be optimized later.</li>
        <li><a href="{% url 'recent' %}">Recent Requests</a>: Shows recent DVM requests by users, making sure not to show too many of any single kind.</li>
        <li><a href="{% url 'dvm' %}">DVM Browser</a>: Search box to look up DVMs and display information about them. Metrics here need to be added.</li>
        <li><a href="{% url 'kind' %}">Kind Browser</a>: Search box to look up Kinds and display information about them. Metrics here need to be added.</li>
        <li><a href="{% url 'debug' event_id="1258f00b94102ed3220de6a05897329e5f5e575c07d77966b303e440570c901c" %}">Debug</a>: Given a request event, this will eventually show a table and graph depicting the interactions among the user and DVMs to accomplish a task.</li>
    </ul>
